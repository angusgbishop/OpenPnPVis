# PnPCAM
 
PnPCAM is an [Open Hardware](https://www.oshwa.org/definition/) project dedicated to bringing high-quality machine vision to the various open source pick-and-place projects.

This project is very much **in development**, clone at your own risk!

The current versions of the board are based off the OnSemi AR0144 image sensor, as it is avaliable through mainline distributers at a reasonable cost for low quantities. 

* Up-to 1200x800 pixel resolution at 30fps (Currently limited by USB Bridge Chip)
* Global shutter
* Standard Webcam USB out
* <s>Onboard LED with exposure-triggered flash</s> (Requirement Dropped)
* LED Expansion Header for third-party use of the flash signal.
* Triggered shutter mode.
* Onboard lens distortion correction.
